Shapes
======

Shapes are a set of cells. There are operations that can produce and combine
shapes. Shapes in themselves does not carry any information, other than being
present or not. Such information is assigned when the shape is placed into an
area together with information about materials.

## Shape groups

Shapes can be unioned in a shape group.
```
shape [translate=<translation: vec3>] [rotate=<rotation: int>] {
	<shape: shape>...
}
```

If only one shape is present:
```
shape [translate=<translation: vec3>] [rotate=<rotation: int>] <shape: shape>
```

## Variables

Variables can be assigned using `=`.

```
Var1 = cell (0, 0, 0);
Var2 = shape {
	cell (0, 0, 0);
	cell (1, 0, 0);
};

Var3 = (1, 0, 1);
Var4 = 5;
```

## Shape producing operators

### `cell <coordinate: vec3>`
`cell` selects a single cell at a specific coordinate.

### `heightmap <file: path> [<coordinate: vec3>]`
`heightmap` selects a set of cells based on a topology map.

### `cube <p0: vec3> <p1: vec3>`
`cube` selects a cube of cells bounded by p0 and p1.

### `hexagon <center: vec3> <radius: int> [<h: int>]
`hexagon` selects a hexagonal plane with a given radius and a given height.

### `between <s1: shape> , <s2: shape>

### `perlin ...`
